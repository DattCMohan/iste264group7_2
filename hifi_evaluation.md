### Overview
We have decided to test our high fidelity prototype by having the partipants sign a consent form to be recorded, and then using Zoom to gain the ability to record both the screen and the participant at the same time. We will be asking them to walk through specific tasks, which are aimed to test the features we had to improve from our low fidelity prototype. We will also be having the participants complete a short heuristic survey to see how we have improved the design from the low fidelity prototype.

We are recording the usability tests because our team has conflicting schedules and we will not be able to all meet with the participants at the same time. This allows us to watch all of the tests, and also allows us to rewatch to take more notes, if necessary.

### Consent Form
The consent form can he found here: *[Consent Form PDF](consent_form.pdf)*

All participants had to sign before conducting the test, because will be sharing the recording of their test.

### Initial Script
When we begin the test, here is the script to be followed to ensure all participants begin with the same information:

### Tasks
Here are the tasks we assigned each participant, in order, to evaluate our prototype:



1. consent form for filming
2. conduct tests separately but film on zoom so we get audio and screen sharing
3. can say we watched each others interviews, as a way to make it okay to test separate
4. specific tasks - aimed at what we needed to fix?
5. have them talk through again, they can do things 'wrong' now, take notes
