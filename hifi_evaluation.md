### Overview
We have decided to test our high fidelity prototype by having the partipants sign a consent form to be recorded, and then using Zoom to gain the ability to record both the screen and the participant at the same time. We will be asking them to walk through specific tasks, which are aimed to test the features we had to improve from our low fidelity prototype. We will also be having the participants complete a short heuristic survey to see how we have improved the design from the low fidelity prototype.

We are recording the usability tests because our team has conflicting schedules and we will not be able to all meet with the participants at the same time. This allows us to watch all of the tests, and also allows us to rewatch to take more notes, if necessary.

### Consent Form
The consent form can he found here: *[Consent Form PDF](consent_form.pdf)*

All participants had to sign before conducting the test, because will be sharing the recording of their test.

### Initial Script
When we begin the test, here is the script to be followed to ensure all participants begin with the same information. This was done before the recording was started, because the consent form was signed after this script:

We are looking to test our high fidelity prototype in order to analyze our improvements from our low fidelity prototype. You will be asked to sign a consent form in order to allow me to record your screen and your comments via zoom. Once this form is signed we will begin the test. You will be asked a series of tasks to complete, and I encourage you to talk through your thinking, so that I can take notes and understand your thought process. After these tasks have been completed, you will be asked to fill out a short google form.

### Tasks
Here are the tasks we assigned each participant, in order, to evaluate our prototype:
1. Log in and edit the meal plan from the 21-22 academic year.
2. Complete both the housing and dining applications for 22-23 academic year.
3. You no longer need housing for the 21-22 school year, find where you cancel the housing application, but keep the meal plan.
4. Go to complete the pending form.

### Evaluation Form
The evaluation form that the participants are completing after going through the tasks can be found *[here](https://forms.gle/RcCZQAJNt1nHjJfH8)*
