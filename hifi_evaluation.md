## High Fidelity Evaluation

### Overview
We have decided to test our high fidelity prototype by having the partipants sign a consent form to be recorded, and then using Zoom to gain the ability to record both the screen and the participant at the same time. We will be asking them to walk through specific tasks, which are aimed to test the features we had to improve from our low fidelity prototype. We will also be having the participants complete a short heuristic survey to see how we have improved the design from the low fidelity prototype.

We are recording the usability tests because our team has conflicting schedules and we will not be able to all meet with the participants at the same time. This allows us to watch all of the tests, and also allows us to rewatch to take more notes, if necessary.

Both the consent form and script are based on the consent form/initial script templates from Rocket Surgery Made Easy website.

#### Consent Form
The consent form can he found here: *[Consent Form PDF](consent_form.pdf)*

All participants had to sign before conducting the test, because will be sharing the recording of their test.

#### Initial Script
When we begin the test, here is the script to be followed to ensure all participants begin with the same information. This was done before the recording was started, because the consent form was signed after this script:

Hi, I'm going to be walking you through this test today. Before we start, we have some information for you. You may have some idea of why we asked you to be here today, but I will go over it again briefly. We are looking to test our high fidelity prototype in order to analyze our improvements from our low fidelity prototype. The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing our design, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here or make any mistakes.
You will be asked a series of tasks to complete, and I encourage you to talk through your thinking and what you're trying to do, so that I can take notes and understand your thought process. After these tasks have been completed, you will be asked to fill out a short google form.
Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.
Lastly, you will be asked to sign a consent form in order to allow me to record your screen and your comments via zoom. Once this form is signed we will begin the test.

#### Tasks
Here are the tasks we assigned each participant, in order, to evaluate our prototype:
1. You no longer need campus housing and you want to change your meal plan for the 21-22 academic year. Log in and edit the meal plan, and then cancel your 21-22 housing request.
2. Although this would typically be done at a later time, please complete both the housing and dining applications for 22-23 academic year.
3. Go to complete the pending form.

### Analysis and Results
... overview here

#### Specific Participant Results

1. Participant 1:
The participant was easily able to login and find the housing & dining application for the changing the meal plan task. They used the top navigation in order to navigate the housing & dining application. When going to select the meal plan to change it, they hesitated at first and made a comment about how they thought it would be under housing. But when they couldn't it there, they found it below the housing tab pretty quickly. For the task to complete the housing & dining applications for the 22-23 academic year, the participant did not go back to the housing & dining application, but stayed in the 21-22 academic year. They were confused, but eventually went through the housing flow. For the cancel housing task, the participant was easily able to find the housing application and went right to the modify or cancel section. Lastly, they were easily able to find the pending form. 

2. Participant 2:
This participant was able to complete all of the tasks. They were able to edit the meal plan and go through the entire housing & dining flow. They moved from the housing part of the application to the meal plan part of the applicatin by clicked on the meal plan button that pops up after clicking on submit for the housing portion. They were also easily able to find the cancel portion of the housing contract, as well as the pending form for those tasks.

3. Participant 3:
This participant experienced some confusion while editing the 21-22 meal plan and cancelling housing. She had saved and exited after cancelling the housing, rather than jumping right to meal plan as we had intended with our design. This is most likely because she had not noticed the meal plan button, as the edit page defaults to the full housing application menu. Additionally, she did not complete the meal plan in the second task, she had also hit save and exit and did not go back. This all could be confusion with the save and exit button as well.

4. Participant 4:
This participant had a minor issue with the save and exit as well, when he edited the meal plan he exited editing the application, and then quickly went back in to cancel housing. He was able to smoothly navigate the rest of the site well.

5. Participant 5:
This participant was able to jump from housing straight to the meal plan successfully in the first task. In the second task this participant was also able to complete it quickly and as efficiently as we intended. In the final task the participant was able to find the form quickly, but got confused on whether he could click on the form in the warning or just in the list of links.

6. Participant 6:
This participant had some confusion when editing their 21-22 meal plan and cancelling housing in the first task. She jumped right to the meal plan and skipped housing then submitted and exit, so she had to go back into the housing / dining section to cancel the housing. During the second task the participant got confused on whether they were in the 21-22 application or the 22-23 application, so she filled out the 21-22 section instead of 22-23 as was intended. This may mean we need a more clear indicator for which application you are filling out while in the forms. The participant also was confused on whether they could click on the pending form in the third task or if they had to click on the blue link below it.

#### Video Recordings
The recordings of the audio and screen of the participants can be found in this google drive folder *[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KyHpb_v4S6cGjn2kiVPZXTvCSSd4evgA?usp=sharing)*. We used these videos as a way to share results with other group members, as we were unable to conduct our tests together due to scheduling conflicts.

#### Conclusion and Takeaways

note - changed tasks after renee tested because theyll work better
ideas for things to change 
1. returning users to housing and dining automatically opened housing, maybe have it on the application tab so they notice that they can select either housing or dining -- eliminates the issue where they left that page after cancelling housing and then had to go back to same page for meal plan
2. Save and exit and save and continue could be confusing. maybe need to go back and just have a save button and a continue button, with a popup when you leave to go to mealplan from housing. maybe an x in the corner so its not as easy to just exit out.
3. modify and cancel seems to be less confusing now that housing and dining are separated... I dont think the separation is causing confusion, just the exit button. Also the fact that its not 'fully' functional as a website
