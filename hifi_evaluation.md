## High Fidelity Evaluation

### Overview
We have decided to test our high fidelity prototype by having the partipants sign a consent form to be recorded, and then using Zoom to gain the ability to record both the screen and the participant at the same time. We will be asking them to walk through specific tasks, which are aimed to test the features we had to improve from our low fidelity prototype. We will also be having the participants complete a short heuristic survey to see how we have improved the design from the low fidelity prototype.

We are recording the usability tests because our team has conflicting schedules and we will not be able to all meet with the participants at the same time. This allows us to watch all of the tests, and also allows us to rewatch to take more notes, if necessary.

Both the consent form and script are based on the consent form/initial script templates from Rocket Surgery Made Easy website.

### Consent Form
The consent form can he found here: *[Consent Form PDF](consent_form.pdf)*

All participants had to sign before conducting the test, because will be sharing the recording of their test.

### Initial Script
When we begin the test, here is the script to be followed to ensure all participants begin with the same information. This was done before the recording was started, because the consent form was signed after this script:

Hi, I'm going to be walking you through this test today. Before we start, we have some information for you. You may have some idea of why we asked you to be here today, but I will go over it again briefly. We are looking to test our high fidelity prototype in order to analyze our improvements from our low fidelity prototype. The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing our design, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here or make any mistakes.
You will be asked a series of tasks to complete, and I encourage you to talk through your thinking and what you're trying to do, so that I can take notes and understand your thought process. After these tasks have been completed, you will be asked to fill out a short google form.
Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.
Lastly, you will be asked to sign a consent form in order to allow me to record your screen and your comments via zoom. Once this form is signed we will begin the test.

### Tasks
Here are the tasks we assigned each participant, in order, to evaluate our prototype:
1. Log in and edit the meal plan from the 21-22 academic year.
2. Complete both the housing and dining applications for 22-23 academic year.
3. You no longer need housing for the 21-22 school year, find where you cancel the housing application, but keep the meal plan.
4. Go to complete the pending form.

### Evaluation Form
