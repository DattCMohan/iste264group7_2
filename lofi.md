### Lofi Prototype

The Figma link to our lofi prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HlYKqKjuSkH1MM4Rj6noa8/Homework-2?node-id=0%3A1). The navigation is shown through arrows linking the pages together.

Our group focused on the layout and navigation of the homepage, and through the housing and dining portal. Many preliminary sketches were made, all while consulting the new [user flow diagram](https://www.figma.com/file/Ml8dmkq7e6or5L46IhrBt0/MyLife?node-id=0%3A1) that we created during our problem analysis.

Example of improvements on the User Flow<br>
Here is the old userflow for housing options compared to our improved version<br>
