### Lofi Prototype
Our group focused on the layout and navigation of the homepage, and through the housing and dining portal. Many preliminary sketches were made, all while consulting the new [user flow diagram](https://www.figma.com/file/Ml8dmkq7e6or5L46IhrBt0/MyLife?node-id=0%3A1) that we created during our problem analysis.

The Figma link to our lofi prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HlYKqKjuSkH1MM4Rj6noa8/Homework-2?node-id=0%3A1). The navigation is shown through arrows linking the pages together.
