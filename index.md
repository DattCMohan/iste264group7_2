## RIT myLife Redesign

### Our Team
- **Emma Thomas** 
- **Renee Bogdany**
- **Christian Mohan**

### Our Customer
Our customer would be RIT, as we are redesigning one of the sites they provide to students.

### Design Problem
The myLife website is used for housing applications, dining meal plans, employment forms, and more. The interface is very hard to use, with the main issues being the site navigation and the overall layout. Our group will be redesigning this application to make a better user flow, and an overall more usable interface.

Here are the main issues we found while navigating the app:
- No global navigation, you can only get to main pages from home
- The home button is inconsistant and unclear, some pages have one, others do not
- Entire header takes you home, which is unclear at first, and creates room for accidental errors and clicks
- Clicking your name takes you to a "page not found" and a link to click to return home
- There is an odd grouping of information for each page
- Unnecessary steps to login, there is a blank page at first, have to click "login" twice

Here are the main issues with the Layout:
- There is ineffective spacing between things
- There is lots of open space, items could be redistributed for clarity
- Text in buttons is hard to read, it is small and in poor resolution

Here are some other errors we have come across from using this app in the past
- There is poor user confirmation - more feedback on actions with form submission
- Lack of clarity in instructions and actions

### Stakeholders - Students?
Our main stakeholders are the students of RIT, who use this interface to access and submit important information about on campus housing and meal plans. All three of us have used these features, and every student at RIT will have to access it at least during their freshman year to find their room assignment.

1. Goals - to make easier and less frustrating and confusing to use. add clarity and proper navigation, make it streamlined
2. Worries - knowing if something actually submitted
3. Ideas - see if anyone has other suggestions besides our own
4. Involvement - we all use it, have other students involved in the redesign process
5. Communication - interview other students from classes, have them test the prototypes to find areas of confusion

### How can Prototyping help?
- Prototyping can help because we are looking at user flow and navigation, it is easy to test this with a prototype
- We would either prototype home screen, and then a landing page for each main topic, or home page and one full flow of one concept - like housing and dining application
