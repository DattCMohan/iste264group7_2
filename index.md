## RIT myLife Redesign
*[Homework 2 - Lofi Prototype](lofi.md)*

### Our Team
- **Emma Thomas** is a second year HCC student interested in UX design and front end development.
- **Renee Bogdany** is a second year HCC student interested in UX research and design.
- **Christian Mohan** is a second year HCC student is interested in UX research and design.

#### Set of Covenants
We have agreed that if a group member misses more than 3 meetings without a reasonable excuse, the other group members can choose to ask them to leave the group. If we cannot come to an agreement, we will all voice our opinions and discuss. If 2/3 members agree, that will be the decision. If 2 group members agree that the 3rd member is not pulling their weight in the group, they will get a warning before asking them to leave.

### Our Customer
Our customer would be RIT, as we are redesigning one of the sites they provide to students.

### Design Problem
The myLife website is used for housing applications, dining meal plans, employment forms, and more. The interface is very hard to use, with the main issues being the site navigation and the overall layout. Our group will be redesigning this application to make a better user flow, and an overall more usable interface.

Here are the main issues/pain points we found while navigating the app:
- No global navigation, you can only get to main pages from home
- The home button is inconsistant and unclear, some pages have one, others do not
- Entire header takes you home, which is unclear at first, and creates room for accidental errors and clicks
- Clicking your name takes you to a "page not found" and a link to click to return home
- There is an odd grouping of information for each page
- Unnecessary steps to login, there is a blank page at first, have to click "login" twice

Here are the main issues with the Layout:
- There is ineffective spacing between things
- There is lots of open space, items could be redistributed for clarity
- Text in buttons is hard to read, it is small and in poor resolution

Here are some other errors/pain points we have come across from using this app in the past
- There is poor user confirmation - more feedback on actions with form submission
- Lack of clarity in instructions and actions

#### Potential New User Flow
Here is a link to a FigJam document containing the current user flow and our first attempt at creating a new user flow.

Example of improvements on the User Flow<br>
Here is the old userflow for housing options compared to our improved version:

### Stakeholders

#### Students
Our main stakeholders are the students of RIT, who use this interface to access and submit important information about on campus housing and meal plans. All three of us have used these features, and every student at RIT will have to access and utilize it at least during their freshman year to find their room assignment.

1. The students’ goals are to easily and quickly use the myLife website in order to complete many different actions, including completing housing applications, dining applications, receiving messages, and submitting maintenance requests. And for incoming students, their goals include easily learning to use and understand how to use the website without any/much experience with something similar because they have to use it before coming to RIT (and will have many other applications/websites to figure out as well).
2. The students’ worries include ensuring that they enter all the correct information and that they complete the correct actions, so that they will be able to achieve their goal for using the website. An example would be filling out the correct roommate and building information for housing applications. However, myLife often does not provide correct feedback for students’ submissions and students are worried that they have not completed the correct actions.
3. Talking to students revealed some changes needed to be made. One is an easier way to login. Logging in is not as simple a task as it should be because it takes the user too many unnecessary clicks and through too many unnecessary screens. A simpler, more understandable navigation was another idea because students often got annoyed trying to get back to the homepage. Another important change that was needed is some sort of feedback for various actions. An example that multiple students had struggled with was attempting to submit a roommate request, but the students never received confirmation that the request was submitted, so they ended up submitting multiple times, which ended up confusing both the students, as well as housing.
4. Stakeholders can be involved in the design process by interviewing RIT students who use the myLife website (especially students who are non-technical majors) about their experiences/ideas for the website.
5. Communication about progress and design can be handled through showing the existing application (the myLife website) and new application designs (sketches, wireframes, prototypes, etc.). We can involve RIT students in the process and understand their way of communicating by interviewing them and conducting usability tests/activities.

#### RIT Administration - including ITS and RIT Housing, Dining, and Maintenance
Our other main stakeholders are the RIT Administration, including ITS, because it is one of the RIT websites used to provide services to its students. It also affects RIT Housing, Dining, and Maintenance because students use the myLife website to interact with these RIT departments.
1. RIT Administration has many goals for the myLife website. It is supposed to handle housing and dining (meal plan) applications, report students’ housing assignments, as well as handle many types of forms - including employment, awards, and maintenance. It should provide all of these things in one place and it should allow students to be able to use it without problems so that it will not cause any issues for any of the Housing, Dining, and Maintenance departments or ITS.
2. They have to worry about new designs being effective so they do not cause any issues for any of the relevant RIT departments, as well as making sure updated designs fit within the wider range of RIT websites and applications (following things like logo, color, and other style guidelines). They also have to worry about designs being feasible to develop without being too time-extensive or costly.
3. Similar communication to students could occur with administration, although it would be more difficult to get in contact with them as opposed to RIT students. But similar contact and interviews with administration in charge of the myLife website could reveal their problems with the website, as well as certain constraints and broader RIT design considerations.

### How can Prototyping help?
Prototyping can help because we are looking at user flow and navigation. It is easy to test a new user flow using a prototype, because we can have users and stakeholders attempt to use the prototype. If there are still usability challeges, this would illuminate them. We can quickly and easily edit the flow of information on a prototype, as opposed to coding the site first.

Here is what we can prototype:
- Welcome page with a login button
- Homescreen with new navigation menu and structure
- Housing application process, our focus will be on the housing flow
- New layout for each of the main content pages

We are prototyping the new navigation flow, because that is the main usability and design problems with the myLife site. We are also prototyping new pages for each of the content sections, as well as the homepage, to fix the layout to make it easily understandable. Some full processes and flows, such as the housing application, will be prototyped to fix clarity issues.

We cannot prototype the actual login screen, as it is done by an outside authentication source.

### Images and Examples of Some of the Main Design Problems
Below is the sequence of screens to get to the login, users should not have to click "login" twice, or be greeted with a blank page.
![login screen](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/login.png)
After clicking the first login, you get to this screen, where you must login again
![login screen 2](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/login2.png)

Here is an example of the empty space and poor layout of the home screen:
![Home screen](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/homescreen.png)

Here is what happens when you click on your name in the menu. This also highlights the sparse navigation menu, and how you have to go home before going to another main page.
![login screen](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/menuscreen.png)
After clicking your name, you are taken to this "Page not Found." This should be a direct link to home, or it should not be clickable.
