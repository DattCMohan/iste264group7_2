### Design Problem
MyLife RIT
Overall Navigation
- only get to other pages from home
- no clear home button
- some have a home button?
- clicking your name takes you to a "page not found"
- entire heading takes you home, not clear and can cause errors
- odd grouping of main pages
- unnecessary steps to login/ blank page, have to click "login" twice

Layout
- no effective spacing
- open space, could be redistributed

User confirmation - more feedback on actions
Text in buttons is fuzzy, small, hard to read
Lack of clarity in instructions and actions

### Stakeholders - Students?
Have to interview students?
1. Goals - to make easier and less frustrating and confusing to use. add clarity and proper navigation, make it streamlined
2. Worries - knowing if something actually submitted
3. Ideas - see if anyone has other suggestions besides our own
4. Involvement - we all use it, have other students involved in the redesign process
5. Communication - interview other students from classes, have them test the prototypes to find areas of confusion

### How can Prototyping help?
- Prototyping can help because we are looking at user flow and navigation, it is easy to test this with a prototype
- We would either prototype home screen, and then a landing page for each main topic, or home page and one full flow of one concept - like housing and dining application
