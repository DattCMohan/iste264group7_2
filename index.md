## RIT myLife Redesign

### Our Team

- **Christian Mohan** is a second year HCC student is interested in UX research and design

#### Set of Covenants
We have agreed that if a group member misses more than 3 meetings without a reasonable excuse, the other group members can choose to ask them to leave the group. If we cannot come to an agreement, we will all voice our opinions and discuss. If 2/3 members agree, that will be the decision. If 2 group members agree that the 3rd member is not pulling their weight in the group, they will get a warning before asking them to leave.

### Our Customer
Our customer would be RIT, as we are redesigning one of the sites they provide to students.

### Design Problem
The myLife website is used for housing applications, dining meal plans, employment forms, and more. The interface is very hard to use, with the main issues being the site navigation and the overall layout. Our group will be redesigning this application to make a better user flow, and an overall more usable interface.

Here are the main issues we found while navigating the app:
- No global navigation, you can only get to main pages from home
- The home button is inconsistant and unclear, some pages have one, others do not
- Entire header takes you home, which is unclear at first, and creates room for accidental errors and clicks
- Clicking your name takes you to a "page not found" and a link to click to return home
- There is an odd grouping of information for each page
- Unnecessary steps to login, there is a blank page at first, have to click "login" twice

Here are the main issues with the Layout:
- There is ineffective spacing between things
- There is lots of open space, items could be redistributed for clarity
- Text in buttons is hard to read, it is small and in poor resolution

Here are some other errors we have come across from using this app in the past
- There is poor user confirmation - more feedback on actions with form submission
- Lack of clarity in instructions and actions

### Stakeholders - Students?
Our main stakeholders are the students of RIT, who use this interface to access and submit important information about on campus housing and meal plans. All three of us have used these features, and every student at RIT will have to access it at least during their freshman year to find their room assignment.

1. Goals - to make easier and less frustrating and confusing to use. add clarity and proper navigation, make it streamlined
2. Worries - knowing if something actually submitted
3. Ideas - see if anyone has other suggestions besides our own
4. Involvement - we all use it, have other students involved in the redesign process
5. Communication - interview other students from classes, have them test the prototypes to find areas of confusion

### How can Prototyping help?
Prototyping can help because we are looking at user flow and navigation. It is easy to test a new user flow using a prototype, because we can have users and stakeholders attempt to use the prototype. If there are still usability challeges, this would illuminate them. We can quickly and easily edit the flow of information on a prototype, as opposed to coding the site first.

Here is what we can prototype:
- Welcome page with a login button
- Homescreen with new navigation menu and structure
- Housing application process, our focus will be on the housing flow
- New layout for each of the main content pages

We are prototyping the new navigation flow, because that is the main usability and design problems with the myLife site. We are also prototyping new pages for each of the content sections, as well as the homepage, to fix the layout to make it easily understandable. Some full processes and flows, such as the housing application, will be prototyped to fix clarity issues.

We cannot prototype the actual login screen, as it is done by an outside authentication source.

### Images and Examples of some of the Main Design Problems
Below is the sequence of screens to get to the login, users should not have to click "login" twice, or be greeted with a blank page.

After clicking the first login, you get to this screen, where you must login again
![login screen 2](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/login2.png)

Here is an example of the empty space and poor layout of the home screen:
![Home screen](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/homescreen.png)

Here is what happens when you click on your name in the menu. This also highlights the sparse navigation menu, and how you have to go home before going to another main page.
![login screen](https://emmathomas36.github.io/iste264group7/menuscreen.png)
After clicking your name, you are taken to this "Page not Found." This should be a direct link to home, or it should not be clickable.
