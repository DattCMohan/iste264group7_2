## Lofi Prototype Evaluation

### Our Method

Each group member met with two people and had them talk through specific tasks. Our group members recorded important details from their interactions and conversations.


1. How would you rate the ability to navigate through the app and understand what you are doing? 
2. How familiar is the wording/phrasing used in the app (especially in relation to other ordering apps that you have used)?
3. Overall, how would you rate the ease of use / user flow of the app? 
5. How common was it for you to make errors when you used the app? (Examples - clicking the wrong button for what you wanted to do, navigating to the wrong page, etc.)
6. How would you rate the ability to find the information you need for each screen (for example - is it on the same page or do you have to go searching for it)?
8. How would you rate the relevance of the features / content on the app? (In other words - is everything on the screen relevant to the purpose of the app or are there unnecessary features)
9. Do you have any additional comments about the app? (Especially anything about navigation or layout)
