## Lofi Prototype Evaluation

### Our Method
Each group member met with two people in person and had them talk through specific tasks. Our group members read the welcome script and then recorded important details from their interactions and conversations as the participants were attempting the tasks. The partipants were asked to complete one task at a time, in the order that they appear below. After the tasks were completed, the participants received a google form to evaluate the heuristics of the website.

#### Welcome Script to all Participants
We are looking to test our prototype for the RIT myLife website to see if it works as we planned it. We want to make it known that you can't make any mistakes or do anything wrong. We are doing this to test our design. And we also really appreciate your honest feedback on our design. So don't worry about criticizing it or worry that you will hurt our feelings, we just want your honest reaction. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them, although we may not want to answer at the time since we want to pretend as if you are trying to use this on your own. Feel free to ask any questions at the end as well. We are going to ask you to complete some tasks and we would appreciate if you would talk your way through the interactions and explain your thinking.

#### Tasks Assigned to Participants
1. Log in and set up a housing and meal plan for the next school year
2. Submit a maintenance request for your bedroom
3. Go back and change the meal plan that you selected for next year
4. Find the roommate agreement

#### Heuristic Evaluation
These are the heuristic questions that were sent to the participants as a google form after they finished walking through the tasks. They will fill this out at the end. Here is the link: 
1. How would you rate the ability to navigate through the app and understand what you are doing? 
2. How familiar is the wording/phrasing used in the app?
3. Overall, how would you rate the ease of use / user flow of the app? 
4. How consistant is the the layout and structure throughout the app?
5. How common was it for you to make errors when you used the app? (Examples - clicking the wrong button for what you wanted to do, navigating to the wrong page, etc.)
6. How would you rate the ability to find the information you need for each screen (for example - is it on the same page or do you have to go searching for it)?
7. How would you rate the relevance of the features / content on the app? (In other words - is everything on the screen relevant to the purpose of the app or are there unnecessary features)
8. Do you have any additional comments about the app? (Especially anything about navigation or layout)
