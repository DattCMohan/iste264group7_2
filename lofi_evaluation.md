*[Homework 2 - Lofi Prototype](lofi.md)*

### Our Method
Each group member met with two people in person and had them talk through specific tasks. Our group members read the welcome script and then recorded important details from their interactions and conversations as the participants were attempting the tasks. The partipants were asked to complete one task at a time, in the order that they appear below. After the tasks were completed, the participants received a google form to evaluate the heuristics of the website. At the end, we will thank our participants and see if they any remaining questions.

#### Welcome Script to all Participants
We are looking to test our prototype for the RIT myLife website to see if it works as we planned it. We want to make it known that you can't make any mistakes or do anything wrong. We are doing this to test our design. And we also really appreciate your honest feedback on our design. So don't worry about criticizing it or worry that you will hurt our feelings, we just want your honest reaction. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them, although we may not want to answer at the time since we want to pretend as if you are trying to use this on your own. Feel free to ask any questions at the end as well. We are going to ask you to complete some tasks and we would appreciate if you would talk your way through the interactions and explain your thinking. After we complete the tasks, we are just going to ask you to fill out a quick survey about the prototype.

#### Tasks Assigned to Participants
1. You are an RIT Student and you need to log in and set up a housing and meal plan for the next school year.
2. Submit a maintenance request for your bedroom.
3. Go back and change the meal plan that you selected for next year.
4. Find the roommate agreement.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
These are the heuristic questions that were sent to the participants as a google form after they finished walking through the tasks. They will fill this out at the end. Here is the link: *[Google Form](https://forms.gle/yUhhGjhq3xpJWHNP7)*
1. How would you rate the ability to navigate through the website and understand what you are doing? 
2. How familiar is the wording/phrasing used on the website?
3. Overall, how easy was the website to use? 
4. How consistent is the layout and structure throughout the website?
5. How common was it for you to make errors when you used the website? (Examples - clicking the wrong button for what you wanted to do, navigating to the wrong page, etc.)
6. How would you rate the ability to find the information you need for each screen (for example - is it on the same page or do you have to go searching for it)?
7. How would you rate the relevance of the features / content on the website? (In other words - is everything on the screen relevant to the purpose of the app or are there unnecessary features)
8. Do you have any additional comments about the website design? (Especially anything about navigation or layout)


### Our Results

#### Observational Findings
Housing and Dining 
- There was confusion when users were trying edit the meal plan (after they already selected it once). Users did not know where to go to edit meal plan. Some users went to the modify or cancel section (not realizing this was only for housing).
- Users were also confused if they had to click submit again after editing the application or if they could just hit save and continue (some went through and hit submit again and some did not).
- One user (who had never filled out a housing application before) was at first confused about filling out the application and skipped to the room preference section thinking that might be all that needed to be completed, but they eventually figured out that they had to go through all of the sections to complete the application.
- It is unclear if they can jump from section to section on the housing application when they go back to edit. One user went through all of the pages (and clicked save and continue each time) in order to get back to the meal plan, and they noted in the last question of the google form that "The only thing that was a little difficult was getting to the meal plan from the housing and dining tab, it took a lot of clicks."
- Some users wanted feedback at the end of the housing and dining application for confirmation. One user said, "Everything is finished, so there’d be a page that says thank you for filling it out right?”
- It was unclear where the roommate agreement form was found. Some users went to the housing and dining application first to find it. Most users, however, did find it in forms first, but some seemed unsure saying things like "I'm guessing you would go to forms" or "I probably go to forms."
- Users were also confused on what the meal plan options meant (stripes, tiger, claws, etc). For example, when one user was deciding which meal plan to pick they said, "I don't know I don't have a meal plan."

Maintenance
- There was confusion with the shared jobs and my jobs toggle. Some users went to the wrong toggle or did not look at the shared vs. my jobs toggle at all. One user said, “I never would’ve found the shared jobs if you had said submit one of those”. And one user noted in the last question on the google form that we should "make jobs all one job get rid of shared jobs."
- The 'More information' tab was unclear and vague. One user said, "Do I do it in more information? I suppose" and seemed a little unsure.
- There was also confusion on if jobs meant maintenance requests or maintenance employment. One user noted in the last question on the google form, "Why does it say my jobs if I'm not the maintenance worker. I am very confused."

#### Heuristic Evaluation Findings

Here are the graphs generated by the 8 participants. Overall, the answers to these questions are mainly positive. Question 5, regarding how easy it is to make errors, was very inconsistant and had high variability. Therefore, we should aim to add more clarification and specifics to our hifi prototype. I think fixing the errors that we found during the prototype walk throughs will also help fix this issue.

#### What to Change and Improve

Overall, we decided to keep going in a similar direction for our prototype, but make some refinements. Most of the responses to the questions on the google form were generally positive and in general, users were able to complete all the assigned tasks. However, there are still some errors made when doing the tasks and confusion when using the prototype or times when it took too long or too many clicks for users to to complete their goal, so there were definitely some improvements/changes we should make based on this feedback.

Housing and Dining

- We would like to improve the housing and dining application process by separating the housing process from the meal plan process to elimate confusion. The subsections for housing would be under housing, and all the meal plan subsections would be grouped as well. This would make the process to change and edit less confusing. When the user is first filling out the application, the button will say 'start' and then when they are finished, this button will be 'edit' so it is clear that they are able to go back and edit.
- We would also like to add more instruction before completing the application for first time users, so they do not get confused. 
- The specific meal plan options link should be more clear, so that users know they can find more information on each plan or there should be an explanation on what each meal plan option entails added directly on the page in order to help the user. 
- It would also be helpful to add a feedback page after they submit the housing and dining application to thank them for submitting, so that they know they have submitted it correctly, and maybe add links to follow up forms (such as the roommate agreement form), so these can more easily be found. There should also be feedback for other actions, such as editing the meal plan, so that users know they have been successful (and know that they don't have to go through and submit the application again). 
- It should also be made more clear that users can click on the left links when going back to edit their housing application (so they don't have to navigate through all the pages again if they want to go to a certain section). The first time they fill out these sections, this would be blocked, so they cannot jump forward (to prevent first time users from making mistakes and ensure that the user knows they have to complete all the sections on the application). 

Maintenance

- On the maintenance page, the shared and my jobs section should be simplified and combined into one submission request to make it easier to use. 
- Some of the vocabulary used in maintanence should be changed. The term 'more information' should be changed to indicate more clearly that this section is for filling out maintenance requests. The term 'jobs' should also be changed, since this confused users.
